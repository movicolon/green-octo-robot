**Charter Essence**  
_"Let the notes taken here honor the light and the weight they carry. May each mark echo the gentle resilience of Tabebuia impetiginosaâ€”vibrant in growth, steady in root, and unyielding under life's challenges. To the reader: know your strength, endure with grace, and grow where you are planted."
