1. *"It’s on you. So, how might you...?"*

   +0H70B3  
   *الحمر في السامر الحسم الشعر*  
   **THE BEST OF PEOPLE**  
   Strain does rife bring the most to those that hold it—benefit to others.  

   **Plan #5949=8**  
   **THE BODY OF:**  
   You create all that is good and grow it. But do you know what’s best for you in all moments? When can you...?  

2. **"LIGHT"**  
   *“Start, and thank.”*  

   Why, when?  
   *Too much strain... who knows?*  
   The duty may weigh heavy, but know this: there’s light in you, a spark deep down. Costs are yours to bear.  

   **#1F6D45**  
   *"A single stone can change your path."*  

   Like a seed growing into bloom, let it guide you. Be calm, like a warm embrace in the cold; you are safe.

### Reflections and Rules

**Chapter 14: Ezras**
   
*Midnight psychology. Darkness in duty.* You bear your own spark. When the way feels heavy, remember this truth.

**“Disregard?”** #1F6D45

*Too much strain?*  
You must take good steps—even when they feel hard. These acts may not be for show. Some say you needn’t lose all for the cause, but bear only what’s fair.

3. **To Save Others or Self**  
   Your life cost is your own. *Two lives are precious.* But if there’s no risk of death, then give what you can.

   These are not merely rules to bind but rather guides to lighten. Letting go of the weight that doesn’t serve helps keep the strain bearable.

**"In all things... choose wisely, weigh what is just.”**
