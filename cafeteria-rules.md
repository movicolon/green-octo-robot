### Cafeteria Rules Sheet

**Welcome to the Cool Existence Club Cafeteria!**
Where good food meets good vibes — here’s how we keep it chill and respectful for everyone.

---

**1. Respect the Space**
Keep the cafeteria clean and tidy. If you spill, wipe it up. If you see trash, pick it up. This is our shared home.

**2. Honor Each Other**
Speak kindly. Listen when others talk. We’re here to build each other up, not tear down.

**3. Share the Table, Share the Vibe**
Save seats for friends or new faces. Everyone deserves a place at the table.

**4. No Taking Christ’s Name in Vain**
Remember to honor the spirit of the Club — speak with respect, especially when it comes to sacred things.

**5. Food is to be Enjoyed, Not Wasted**
Take only what you’ll eat. Leftovers can be shared, but wasting food is never cool.

**6. Patience is a Power Move**
Wait your turn in line without rushing or pushing. Cool elders lead with calm and grace.

**7. Use Your Inside Voice**
Keep noise at a level that lets everyone enjoy their meal and conversation.

**8. Help Out When You Can**
If you see someone needing a hand—whether with trays, plates, or carrying drinks—offer to help.

**9. No Drama Zone**
Leave the drama outside. The cafeteria is a place for peace, good energy, and connection.

**10. Clean Up After Yourself**
When you’re done eating, clear your spot and return trays to the designated area.

**11. Keep Electronics Cool**
Phones and devices are welcome but use them thoughtfully—don’t interrupt others’ flow.

**12. Stay Open and Friendly**
Say hi. Smile. Be a welcoming presence for everyone who walks in.

**13. Remember: We’re Elders in This Space**
Act with wisdom, patience, and respect—because how we show up here reflects who we are as the Cool Existence Club.
